## Introduction

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodoros", the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- NPM

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory
3. Install the project dependencies using `npm install`
4. Start the application using `npm start`

## Implementation

This project uses the following technologies:

- React.js
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

The `App.js` file contains the main logic for the timer. The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the timer, including the title, time left, and whether the timer is currently running. The `useRef` hook is used to reference the interval created by the `setInterval` function, allowing the interval to be cleared when the timer is stopped or reset.

The `padTime` function is used to add a leading zero to the minutes and seconds values when they are less than 10.

The `startTimer`, `stopTimer`, and `resetTimer` functions are used to manage the state of the timer and update the timer display accordingly.
